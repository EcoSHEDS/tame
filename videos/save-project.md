## Saving and Publishing A Project

Welcome to this tutorial on Saving and Publishing a Project in TAME.

We'll pick up where we left off from the Create a Project video, and use this example dataset of Brown Trout on the Deerfield River.

So far, TAME has not sent any of this data or related information to the server.

this project has only been created locally within my web browser and none of the data or settings have been sent to the server. If I were to close my broser, then the project would be lost.

But if I want to return to it later, or share it with other users, then I can save it by clicking the Save button.

Now in order to save a project, I must have an account. Note that an account was NOT required to create a project, as we just did, it's only needed if you want to save the project to the server.

If you're new to TAME, you can sign up for an account, or if you already have one, then you just need to log in.

Once you're logged in, then we'll click Save again, and TAME will ask for some information about the project.

First, we give the project a name, which usually includes the species and general area where data were collected, such as Brown Trout in the Deerfield River. But for this example, I'll simply call this Tutorial Project.

Next we enter a project ID, which is used for assigning the uniqu URL that will point to this project. The ID can only contain letters, numbers and dashes, and it will be automatically generated based on the project name, but you can change it if you wish. An ID must be unique across of the projects in TAME, so if an ID is already in use, TAME will ask you choose another.

Note that the ID cannot be changed later, unlike the other fields in this form.

The next option specifies whether you want to publish this project. Publishing a project means that it will be shown in the list of available projects whenever someone clicks the Load Project button. We will talk more about publishing in the last section, so for now I'll leave this unchecked.

Next, we provide a description for the project, which may include the targetted species, region, organization or person who collected the data, etc.

Lastly, we can provide an optional citation or URL to the source dataset if you want other users to be able to download this dataset. But for now, I'll leave that blank.


We click submit and TAME will save this project to the server.

And once its been saved, we see the URL for this project.

It is important to note that anyone with this URL will be able to access this project. That way, I can send it to my collaborators who will be able to view the project without having to create an account. However, it also means that anyone with this URL will be able to access the project. And this can happen whether the project is published or not.

The only difference with a published project is that it not only has a direct URL, but it will also be listed under the publicly available projects on the Load Project screen, as we'll see in a minute.

NOw that we've saved the project, I'll close this. And if I click the About button here, we'll see the information I just entered about the project, as well as its URL.



Now if I close the project, then we're taken back to the welcome screen.

From here, I can return to that project by going to Load Projects.

And at the top, I see a list of my projects, the first of which is the Tutorial Project we just created.

Below that, there is a list of Published Projects from all TAME users.

Since this project was not published, it only appears in the first list. In other words, it is only visible to me when I am logged in.

And I can get back to it, by clicking the Load Project button.

Now, if I decide later that I would like to publish it, I can go back to Save, and check the Publish Project option. Also note, that I can change any of the other fields here, except for the ID.

And click Save.

And now if I go back to Load Project, we see it is included in the list of Published Projects.

Lastly, if I no longer want my project saved on the server, I can go to Delete, and then click Confirm. And now the project and its dataset have been deleted, and no longer appears under My Projects or the Published Projects.
 
So if your project contains highly sensitive data that you do not want anyone to access under any circumstances, then do not save the project to the server, and only use TAME locally by not saving it.Once again, until you save a project, no data or information is sent to the server.

And that wraps up saving and publishing. In the next video, we'll talk about editing a project.
