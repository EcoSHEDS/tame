## Part 3: Editing A Project

After a project has been created, you can click the Edit button to update the dataset or change any of the settings.

This will open the same multi-step form we used to create the project originally.

You can update the dataset by selecting a new file on your computer. Note that TAME only lets you replace the entire dataset, it does not support appending new observations by loading a new file.

For this dataset, we initially had about 3,300 rows. And if I select the updated dataset, then TAME will load this file, and we see it has about 4,400 rows. So we have updated the dataset.

TAME will also check if any of the column names have changed, and if so, will show errors on the remaining steps that need to be addressed.
